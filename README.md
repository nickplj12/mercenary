ai discord chatbot

## prerequisites
* python-dotenv
* discord.py
* replicate

## how to use??
if you do not already have a replicate account nor have made a discord bot, you can make one by going to these links:
https://replicate.com
https://discord.com/developers/applications

for the discord bot, enable these settings:
- PRESENCE INTENT
- SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
- MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT

make sure you get all the files in the repository.

change the .env file to include your discord bot token and your replicate api token.

in main.py, you can edit the prompt to your liking or you can leave it the same as it is.
