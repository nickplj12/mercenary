ai discord chatbot

## prerequisites
* python-dotenv
* discord.py
* replicate

## how to use??
make sure you get all the files in the repository.
change the .env file to include your discord bot token and your replicate api token.
if you do not already have a replicate account, you can make one by going to https://replicate.com

in main.py, you can edit the prompt to your liking or you can leave it the same as it is.
